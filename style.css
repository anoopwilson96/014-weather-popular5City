/* 1. .mSection1:

This code block defines a CSS class named .mSection1. It sets the padding of the element to 1rem using the padding property. 
A rem unit is relative to the font size of the root element (usually the <html> element). So, if the font size of the root element is 16px, then 1rem would be equal to 16px. */

  /*2. .slider-wrapped:
  
  This code block defines a CSS class named .slider-wrapped. It sets the following properties for the element:
  
  position: relative: This sets the positioning of the element relative to its normal position in the document flow. 
  This allows the child element .slider-nav to be positioned absolutely within the .slider-wrapped element.
  max-width: 60rem: This sets the maximum width of the element to 60rem (rem units).
  margin: 0 auto: This sets the margin of the element to 0 on the top and bottom, and auto on the left and right sides. 
  This will center the element horizontally within its parent container. */

  /*3. .slider:
  
  This code block defines a CSS class named .slider. It sets the following properties for the element:
  
  display: flex: This sets the element to be displayed as a flex container, allowing its child elements to be arranged flexibly.
  aspect-ratio: 16/9: This sets the aspect ratio of the element to 16:9, which is a common aspect ratio for widescreen displays.
  overflow-x: auto: This sets the overflow behavior for the x-axis to auto. This will add a horizontal scrollbar if the content overflows the width of the container.
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory: This enables scroll snapping on the x-axis, and sets the snap points to be mandatory. This means that the scrolling will snap to the nearest image when the user scrolls.
  scroll-behavior: smooth: This sets the scrolling behavior to be smooth, meaning that the scrolling will animate when the user interacts with the scrollbar.
  box-shadow: 0 1.5rem 3rem -0.75rem hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25): This adds a box shadow to the element with the following properties:
  The first two values (0 1.5rem) specify the horizontal and vertical offset of the shadow, respectively.
  The third value (3rem) specifies the blur radius of the shadow.
  The fourth value (-0.75rem) specifies the spread of the shadow.
  hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.25) specifies the color of the shadow as a black color with 25% opacity.
  border-radius: .5rem: This sets the border radius of the element to 0.5rem, which creates rounded corners. */

  /* 4. .slider img:
  
  This code block defines styles for images within the element with the class .slider. It sets the following properties:
  
  flex: 1 0 100%: This sets the flex properties for the image.
  flex: 1: This makes the image flex and grow to fill the available space in the flex container.
  0: This sets the minimum width of the image to be 0.
  100%: This sets the width of the image to be 100% of the available space in the flex container.
  scroll-snap-align: start: This aligns the image to the start of the scroll snap point.
  object-fit: cover: This sets the object-fit property of the image to "cover". This will resize the image to cover the entire area of its container, while maintaining its aspect ratio. 
  If the image is larger than the container, it will be cropped to fit. */

  /* 5. .slider-nav:
  
  This code block defines a CSS class named .slider-nav. It sets the following properties for the element:
  
  display: flex: This sets the element to be displayed as a flex container, allowing its child elements (the navigation dots) to be arranged in a row.
  column-gap: 1rem: This sets the gap between the navigation dots to 1rem.
  position: absolute: This sets the positioning of the element to absolute. This allows the element to be positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor element (which is .slider-wrapped in this case).
  left: 50%;: This sets the left edge of the element to 50% of its containing element's width.
  transform: translateX(-50%);: This translates the element horizontally by -50% of its own width. This is commonly used with absolute positioning to center the element horizontally within its containing element.
  z-index: 1;: This sets the stacking order of the element. An element with a higher z-index will be displayed on top of elements with lower z-indexes. In this case, setting z-index: 1 ensures that the navigation dots are displayed on top of the slider images. */
